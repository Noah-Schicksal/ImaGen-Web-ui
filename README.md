ImaGen was just a way for me to play a bit with image generation using artificial intelligence, itâ€™s not very complex and was created simply, but it works, in fact even better than I expected. To function correctly, you just need to install the requirements using: 

pip install -r requirements.txt

it is still not possible to open it through a bat file or executable since I don't have much experience with that.
